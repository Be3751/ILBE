# ILBE
 
ILbe is a web application created with Django. We created this app to make our lab, ISDL - Intelligent Systems Design Laboratory, clean and neat. Users can register items left behind in our lab, see a list of those items, and check information of each items in the app. When items are registered, they are automatically tagged with discard deadlines.

# Note
 
This app is still seemed to have some potential problems. So, we're planning to fix and update it.
